Automation will be one of the big technological shifts of our generation. <br> We think that it's important that the transition happens in a way that benefits the whole of humanity, rather than a small privileged group.  <br><br>  We don't follow the normal rules for research. We value speed and resourcefulness above all else, and find that complex research projects can be carried out for one hundredth of the cost and in one-tenth of the timeframe traditionally expected. <br><br> Interested in helping?
